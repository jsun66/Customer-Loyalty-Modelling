# Customer-Loyalty-Modelling
This project aims to model and predict whether a customer will leave the bank in the near future. **The detailed analysis and insights are shown in the Jupyter Notebook.**
The management team is able to use the analysis and insights for their decision making to enhance customer relationship and retain the customers as much as possible.
